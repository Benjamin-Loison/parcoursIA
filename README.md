**Session 1 : Introduction to Signal Processing.** Sampling, Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) and digital filters.<br>
**Session 2 : Introduction to Statistical Signal Processing.** Basic statistics, autocorrelation function, Power Spectral Density (PSD) estimators and spectrogram.<br>
**Session 3 : Time series models** Signal+noise model, sinusoidal model, trend+seasonality model and autoregressive models.<br>
**Session 4 : Representation and dictionary learning** Notion of sparsity, sparse coding (l0 and l1), dictionary learning.<br>
**Session 5 : Pre-processing** Denoising, detrending, removal of impulsive noise, interpolation and change point detection.<br>
**Session 6 : Feature extraction and selection** Classical feature extraction, unsupervised feature selection with PCA, supervised feature selection (filter, wrapper and embedded methods).<br>
**Session 7 : Pattern detection and extraction** Distances between time series (Euclidean, normalized Euclidean and DTW), pattern detection and distance-based pattern extraction.
